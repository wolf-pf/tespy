There are two different types of combustion chambers available. The combustion chamber can handle varying fluid compositions for the air and the fuel and calculates the fluid composition of the flue gas. Thus, it is possible to e. g. specify the oxygen mass fraction in the flue gas in a calculation. In contrast, the stoichiometric combustion chamber uses fuel and air as pseudo pure gases for the input at calculates a mixture of stoichiometric flue gas and air at the outlet. The sacrifice of flexibility for parametrisation results in a faster solution process. Thus, if the air composition and the fuel composition are known prior to calculation, it is always recommended to use the stoichiometric combustion chamber. We provide a tutorial for both components, where you learn how they work, and what the differences are.
	
combustion chamber
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	
The combustion chamber is an important component within thermal power plants, but unfortunately is the reason for many issues, as the solving algorithm is very sensitive to small changes e. g.
the fluid composition. We will demonstrate how to handle the combustion chamber in a very small, simple example. You can download the full code from the `tespy_examples repository <https://github.com/oemof/oemof-examples/tree/master/oemof_examples/tespy/combustion_chamber>`_.

First of all you need to define the network containing all fluid components used for the combustion chamber. **These are at least the fuel, oxygen, carbon-dioxide and water**. For this example we added Argon, and of course - as we are using Air for the combustion - Nitrogen.
On top, it is highly recommended to specify reasonable ranges for the fluid properties. If you have fluid mixtures within your network, the fluid property ranges will keep your fluid properties within the specified ranges for the first three steps of the newton's algorithm in order to stabilize the calculation.

.. code-block:: python

	from tespy import con, cmp, nwk

	# %% network

	# define full fluid list for the network's variable space
	fluid_list = ['Ar', 'N2', 'O2', 'CO2', 'CH4', 'H2O']
	# define unit systems and fluid property ranges
	nw = nwk.network(fluids=fluid_list, p_unit='bar', T_unit='C',
					 p_range=[0.5, 10], T_range=[10, 1200])
					 
As components there are two sources required, one for the fresh air, one for the fuel, a sink for the flue gas and the combustion chamber. Connect the components and add the connections to your network afterwards.

.. code-block:: python

	# %% components

	# sinks & sources
	amb = cmp.source('ambient')
	sf = cmp.source('fuel')
	fg = cmp.sink('flue gas outlet')

	# combustion chamber
	comb=cmp.combustion_chamber(label='combustion chamber')

	# %% connections

	amb_comb = con.connection(amb, 'out1', comb, 'in1')
	sf_comb = con.connection(sf, 'out1', comb, 'in2')
	comb_fg = con.connection(comb, 'out1', fg, 'in1')

	nw.add_conns(sf_comb, amb_comb, comb_fg)
	
For the parametrisation specify the combustions chambers fuel (we chose methane for this example, for all available fuels check for the :py:class:`combustion chamber in the API <tespy.components.components.combustion_chamber>`.), the air to stoichmetric air ratio lamb and the thermal input (:math:`LHV \cdot \dot{m}_{f}`).

.. code-block:: python

	# %% component parameters

	# set combustion chamber fuel, air to stoichometric air ratio and thermal input
	comb.set_attr(fuel='CH4', lamb=3, ti=20000)
	
The ambient conditions as well as the fuel gas inlet temperature are defined in the next step. The air and the fuel gas composition must fully be stated, the component combustion chamber can not handle "Air" as input fluid!

.. code-block:: python

	# %% connection parameters
								 
	# air from abient (ambient pressure and temperature), air composition must be
	# stated component wise.
	amb_comb.set_attr(p=1, T=20,
					  fluid={'Ar': 0.0129, 'N2': 0.7553, 'H2O': 0,
							 'CH4': 0, 'CO2': 0.0004, 'O2': 0.2314})

	# fuel, pressure must not be stated, as pressure is the same at all inlets and
	# outlets of the combustion chamber
	sf_comb.set_attr(T=25,
					 fluid={'CO2': 0.04, 'Ar': 0, 'N2': 0,
							'O2': 0, 'H2O': 0, 'CH4': 0.96})
							
Finally run the code:

.. code-block:: python

	# %% solving

	mode = 'design'
	nw.solve(mode=mode)
	nw.print_results()
	nw.save('combustion')
	
Of course, you can change the parametrisation in any desired way. For example instead of stating the thermal input, you could choose any of the mass flows, or instead of the air to stoichometric air ratio you could specify the flue gas temperature.
It is also possible to make modifications on the fluid composition, for example stating the oxygen content of the flue gas.

stoichiometric combustion chamber
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The example for the stoichiometric combustion chamber can as well be taken from the `tespy_examples repository <https://github.com/oemof/oemof-examples/tree/master/oemof_examples/tespy/combustion_chamber>`_.

Again, the network must have the information, which fluids will be part of the fluid vector. In contrast to the normal combustion chamber, you will need the following fluids: **Air, Fuel and Flue Gas**. For this tutorial we will call them: **"TESPy::myAir", "TESPy::myFuel" and "TESPy::myFuel_fg"**, we will see, why we chose these names for the fluids later.
Do not forget to specify the ranges for pressure and temperature. This is a very important stept for this specific component, we will explain later, why it is.

.. code-block:: python

	from tespy import con, cmp, nwk

	# %% network

	# define full fluid list for the network's variable space
	fluid_list = ['TESPy::myAir', 'TESPy::myFuel', 'TESPy::myFuel_fg']
	# define unit systems and fluid property ranges
	nw = nwk.network(fluids=fluid_list, p_unit='bar', T_unit='C',
					 p_range=[1, 10], T_range=[10, 2000])

The components required are then the same as in the first tutorial, the stoichiometric combustion chamber's class is called "combustion_chamber_stoich".					 
As components there are two sources required, one for the fresh air, one for the fuel, a sink for the flue gas and the combustion chamber. Connect the components and add the connections to your network afterwards.

.. code-block:: python

	# %% components
	
	# sinks & sources
	amb = cmp.source('ambient')
	sf = cmp.source('fuel')
	fg = cmp.sink('flue gas outlet')

	# combustion chamber
	comb = cmp.combustion_chamber_stoich('stoichiometric combustion chamber')

	# %% connections

	amb_comb = con.connection(amb, 'out1', comb, 'in1')
	sf_comb = con.connection(sf, 'out1', comb, 'in2')
	comb_fg = con.connection(comb, 'out1', fg, 'in1')

	nw.add_conns(sf_comb, amb_comb, comb_fg)
	
The basic parametrisation of the stoichiometric combustion chamber is different compared to the normal combustion chamber: We need to specify the air and the fuel composition, and additionally, aliases for the these fluids. Since air and fuel usually are mixtures of different gases, **TESPy will create lookup tables for the fluid properties of the specified air and fuel composition and a third lookup table for the flue gas**. TESPy will therefore calculate the stoichiometric flue gas composition. The fluids will then be accessable with the following aliases: **"TESPy::youraliasforair", "TESPy::youraliasforfuel" and "TESPy::youraliasforfuel_fg"**. The creation of the lookup tables will use your network's settings: **The fluid properties will be calculated within the network's specified ranges for pressure and temperature.**

A folder called "LUT" will be created in your working directory containing all fluid property lookup tables. As the creation of the lookup tables does take some time, it is possible, to read the fluid properties from that folder: You need to specify the path variable, like this: :code:`path='./LUT'`.

There are some important things to keep in mind, when reading the fluid properties from path:

- **Do not specify the path in case**

	- you change the pressure range or the temperature range or
	- you change the air or the fuel composition.

- **For convergence stability choose large maximum temperatures**, much higher than the highest temperature you are expecting at the combustion chambers outlet.
- **If you use more than one combustion chamber** do not use identical aliases, if the fluid compositions are not identical.

As in the example above, we also specify thermal input and lambda, as well as identical parameters for the connections. Thus the results should be exactly the same.

.. code-block:: python

	# %% component parameters

	# for the first calculation run
	comb.set_attr(fuel={'CH4': 0.96, 'CO2': 0.04},
				  air={'Ar': 0.0129, 'N2': 0.7553, 'H2O': 0,
					   'CH4': 0, 'CO2': 0.0004, 'O2': 0.2314},
				  fuel_alias='myFuel', air_alias='myAir',
				  lamb=3, ti=20000)
				  
	# if there are existing lookup tables
	comb.set_attr(fuel={'CH4': 0.96, 'CO2': 0.04},
				  air={'Ar': 0.0129, 'N2': 0.7553, 'H2O': 0,
					   'CH4': 0, 'CO2': 0.0004, 'O2': 0.2314},
				  fuel_alias='myFuel', air_alias='myAir', path='./LUT',
				  lamb=3, ti=20000)
				  
.. code-block:: python

	# %% connection parameters
								 
	# air from abient (ambient pressure and temperature), air composition must be
	# stated component wise.
	amb_comb.set_attr(T=20, p=1,
					  fluid={'TESPy::myAir': 1, 'TESPy::myFuel': 0,
							 'TESPy::myFuel_fg': 0})

	# fuel, pressure must not be stated, as pressure is the same at all inlets and
	# outlets of the combustion chamber
	sf_comb.set_attr(T=25,
					 fluid={'TESPy::myAir': 0, 'TESPy::myFuel': 1,
							'TESPy::myFuel_fg': 0})
							
Finally run the code:

.. code-block:: python

	# %% solving

	mode = 'design'
	nw.solve(mode=mode)
	nw.print_results()
	nw.save('combustion')
