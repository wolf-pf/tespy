Task
^^^^

This tutorial introduces you in how to model a heat pump in TESPy. You can see the plants topology in figure 1. Also, you will find a fully working model in the last chapter of this tutorial.

    Figure 1: Topology of the heat pump.
	
The main purpose of the heat pump is to deliver heat e. g. for the consumers of a heating system. Thus, the heat pump's parameters will be set in a way, which supports this target.
Generally, if systems are getting more complex, it is highly recommended to set up your plant in incremental steps. This tuturial divides the plant in three sections: The consumer part, the valve and the evaporator and the compressor as last element. Each new section will be appended to the existing ones.


Set up a Network
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to simulate our heat pump we have to create an instance of the tespy.network class. The network is the main container of the model and will be required in all following sections.
First, it is necessary to specify a list of the fluids used in the plant. In this example we will work with water (H\ :sub:`2`\O) and ammonia (NH\ :sub:`3`\). Water is used for the cold side of the heat exchanger, for the consumer and for the hot side of the environmental temperature. Ammonia is used as coolant within the heat pump circuit.
If you don’t specify the unit system, the variables are set to SI-Units.

.. code-block:: python

    from tespy import nwk, con, cmp

    nw = nwk.network(fluids=['water' , 'NH3'],
					 T_unit='C', p_unit='bar', h_unit='kJ / kg', m_unit='kg / s')
	
We will use °C, bar and kJ/kg as units for temperature and enthalpy.
	
Modeling the heat pump: Consumer system
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Components
++++++++++

We will start with the consumer as the plant will be designed to deliver a specific heat flow. From figure 1 you can determine the components of the consumer system: condenser, pump and the consumer (heat-exchanger-simple). Additionally we need a source and a sink for the consumer and the heat pump circuit respectively. We label the sink for the coolant "valve", as for our next calculation the valve (labeled "valve") will be attached there. In this way, the fluid properties can be initialised by csv at the interface-connection, too.

.. code-block:: python
	
	# sources & sinks

	c_in = cmp.source('coolant in')
	cb = cmp.source('consumer back flow')
	cf = cmp.sink('consumer feed flow')

	ves = cmp.sink('valve')

	# consumer system

	cd = cmp.condenser('condenser')
	rp = cmp.pump('recirculation pump')
	cons = cmp.heat_exchanger_simple('consumer')
	
Connections
+++++++++++

In the next steps we will connect the components in order to form a network. Every connection requires the source, the source id, the target and the target id as arguments: the source is the component from which the connection originates, the source id is the outlet id of that component. This applies analogously to the target. To find all inlet and outlet ids of a component look up the class documentation.

.. code-block:: python

	# consumer system

	c_in_cd = con.connection(c_in, 'out1', cd, 'in1')

	cb_rp = con.connection(cb, 'out1', rp, 'in1')
	rp_cd = con.connection(rp, 'out1', cd, 'in2')
	cd_cons = con.connection(cd, 'out2', cons, 'in1')
	cons_cf = con.connection(cons, 'out1', cf, 'in1')

	nw.add_conns(c_in_cd, cb_rp, rp_cd, cd_cons, cons_cf)

	# connection condenser - evaporator system

	cd_ves = con.connection(cd, 'out1', ves, 'in1')

	nw.add_conns(cd_ves)


Parametrization
+++++++++++++++

For the condenser we set pressure ratios on hot and cold side and additionally we set a value for the upper terminal temperature difference as design parameter and the heat transfer coefficient as offdesign parameter. The consumer will have a pressure ratio, too. Further we set the isentropic efficiency for the pump, the offdesign efficiency is calculated with a characteristic function. Thus, we set the efficiency as design parameter and the characteristic function as offdesign parameter. In offdesign calculation the consumer's pressure ratio will be a function of the mass flow, thus as offdesign parameter we select zeta. The most important parameter is the consumers heat demand. We marked this setting as key parameter.

.. code-block:: python

	cd.set_attr(pr1=0.99, pr2=0.99, ttd_u=5, design=['pr2', 'ttd_u'], offdesign=['zeta2', 'kA'])
	rp.set_attr(eta_s=0.8, design=['eta_s'], offdesign=['eta_s_char'])
	cons.set_attr(pr=0.99, design=['pr'], offdesign=['zeta'])
	
.. note::

	In TESPy there are two different types of calculations: design point and offdesign calculation. All parameters specified in the design attribute of a component or connection, will be unset in a offdesign calculation, all parameters specified in the offdesign attribute of a component or connection will be set for the offdesign calculation. The value for these parameters is the value deriven from the design-calculation.
	
	Generally, the design calculation is used for designing your system in the way you want it to look like. This means, that you might want to specify a design point isentropic efficiency, pressure loss or terminal temperature difference.
	After you have designed your system, you are able to make offdesign calculations with TESPy. The offdesign calculation is used to predict the system's behaviour at different points of operation. For this case, this might be different ambient temperature, different feed flow temperature, or partial load.

In order to calculate this network further parametrization is necessary, as e. g. the fluids are not determined yet: At the hot inlet of the condensator we define the temperature and the fluid vector. In order to fully determine the fluid's state at this point, an information on the pressure is required. This is archieved by setting the terminal temperature difference (see above). The same needs to be done for the consumer cycle. We suggest to set the parameters at the pump's inlet. On top, we assume that the consumer requires a constant inlet temperature.

The last step is to define the fluid's state after the consumer, this is done with references to the pump's inlet, in order to grant that the fluid properties at the consumer's outlet are identical to those at the pump's inlet.

.. code-block:: python

	c_in_cd.set_attr(T=170, fluid={'water': 0, 'NH3': 1})
	cb_rp.set_attr(T=60, p=10, fluid={'water': 1, 'NH3': 0})
	cd_cons.set_attr(T=90)
	cons_cf.set_attr(h=con.ref(cb_rp, 1, 0), p=con.ref(cb_rp, 1, 0))

.. code-block:: python
	
	# %% key parameter
	
	cons.set_attr(Q=-230e3)	

Solve
+++++

After creating the system, we want to solve our network. First, we calculate the design case and directly after we can perform the offdesign calculation at a different value for our key parameter. For general information on the solving process in TESPy and available parameters check the corresponding section in :ref:`Using TESPy <using_tespy_networks_label>`.

.. code-block:: python

	nw.solve('design')
	nw.print_results()
	nw.save('condenser')

	cons.set_attr(Q=-200e3)

	nw.solve('offdesign', design_path='condenser')
	nw.print_results()


Valve and evaporator system
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next we will add the valve and the evaporator system to our existing network.

Components
++++++++++

This part contains of a valve followed by a drum with evaporator in forced flow and a superheater. Do not forget to change the old sink labeled "valve" to an actual valve and the sink used in the previous calculation will represent the first compressor, labeled "compressor 1". Add the following components to the script.

.. code-block:: python

	# sources & sinks
	
	amb_in = cmp.source('source ambient')
	amb_out = cmp.sink('sink ambient')

	cp1 = cmp.sink('compressor 1')

	# evaporator system

	ves = cmp.valve('valve')
	dr = cmp.drum('drum')
	ev = cmp.heat_exchanger('evaporator')
	su = cmp.heat_exchanger('superheater')
	pu = cmp.pump('pump evaporator')

Connections
+++++++++++

As we already redefined our variable "ves" to be a valve instead of a sink (see above), we do not need any adjustments to the connection between the condenser and the former sink "cd_ves". The valve connects to the drum at the inlet 'in1'. The pump of the forced flow evaporation system connects to the drum's outlet 'out1', the evaporator's cold side connects to the drum's inlet 'in2' and the superheater's cold side connects to the drum's outlet 'out2'. This will add the following connections to the model:

.. code-block:: python

	# evaporator system

	ves_dr = con.connection(ves, 'out1', dr, 'in1')
	dr_pu = con.connection(dr, 'out1', pu, 'in1')
	pu_ev = con.connection(pu, 'out1', ev, 'in2')
	ev_dr = con.connection(ev, 'out2', dr, 'in2')
	dr_su = con.connection(dr, 'out2', su, 'in2')

	nw.add_conns(ves_dr, dr_pu, pu_ev, ev_dr, dr_su)

	amb_in_su = con.connection(amb_in, 'out1', su, 'in1')
	su_ev = con.connection(su, 'out1', ev, 'in1')
	ev_amb_out = con.connection(ev, 'out1', amb_out, 'in1')

	nw.add_conns(amb_in_su, su_ev, ev_amb_out)

	# connection evaporator system - compressor system

	su_cp1 = con.connection(su, 'out2', cp1, 'in1')

Parametrization
+++++++++++++++

Previous parametrization stays untouched. Regarding the evaporator, we specify pressure ratios on hot and cold side as well as the lower terminal temperature difference. We use the hot side pressure ratio and the lower terminal temperature difference as design parameteres and choose zeta as well as the area independet heat transition coefficient as its offdesign parameters. On top of that, the characteristic function of the evaporator should follow the predefined methods 'EVA_HOT' and 'EVA_COLD'. If you want to learn more about handling characteristic functions you should have a glance at the :ref:`TESPy components section <using_tespy_components_label>`. The superheater will also use the pressure ratios on hot and cold side. Further we set a value for the upper terminal temperature difference. For the pump we set the isentropic efficiency. For offdesign and design parameter specification of these components the same logic as for the evaporator and the already existing part of the network is applied: The system designer has to answer the question: Which parameters are design point parameters and how does the component perform at a different operation point.

.. code-block:: python

	# evaporator system

	ev.set_attr(pr1=0.99, pr2=0.99, ttd_l=5,
            	kA_char1='EVA_HOT', kA_char2='EVA_COLD',
				design=['pr1', 'ttd_l'], offdesign=['zeta1', 'kA'])
	su.set_attr(pr1=0.99, pr2=0.99, ttd_u=2, design=['pr1', 'pr2', 'ttd_u'], offdesign=['zeta1', 'zeta2', 'kA'])
	pu.set_attr(eta_s=0.8, design=['eta_s'], offdesign=['eta_s_char'])
	
Next step is the connetion parametrization: The pressure in the drum and the enthalpy of the wet steam reentering the drum need to be determined. For the enthalpy we can specify a reference of the circulating mass flow to the main cycle mass flow. The pressure is archieved through the given lower terminal temperature difference of the evaporator and its hot side outlet temperature. As we have specified a terminal temperature difference at the evaporator's cold side inlet (:code:`ttd_l`), it might be necessary to state a starting value for the pressure, as we are near to the two-phase region. On the hot side inlet of the superheater we definde the temperature, pressure and the fluid. Since the pressure between superheater and first compressor will be a result of the pressure losses in the superheater and we set the terminal temperature difference there, bad starting values will lead to a linear dependency, as a temperature and a pressure are set while the fluid's state could be within the two phase region. Thus, we set starting values for pressure and for enthalpy at this connection, to make sure the starting point is outside of the two phase region. At last we have to fully determine the state of the incoming fluid at the superheater's hot side. 


.. code-block:: python

	# evaporator system cold side

	pu_ev.set_attr(m=con.ref(ves_dr, 4, 0), p0=5)
	su_cp1.set_attr(p0=5, h0=1700)

	# evaporator system hot side

	amb_in_su.set_attr(T=12, p=1, fluid={'water': 1, 'NH3': 0})
	ev_amb_out.set_attr(T=9)
	
Solve
+++++

Again, you should calculate your network after you added these parts. As we have already calculated one part of our network, this time we can use the :code:`init_path` for the design calculation and load the results from the previous network. This step is not required, but in larger, more complex networks, it might help, to archieve better convergence. For the offdesign calculation see part 3.1.4.

	
Compressor system
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To complete the heat pump, we will add the compressor system to our existing network.

Components
++++++++++

This part contains two compressors with an intercooler between them. The cold side of the intercooler requires a source and a sink. Again, remember redefining the former sink "cp1" to a compressor and add a sink for the outlet of the coolant after the compressor system.

.. code-block:: python

	# sources & sinks
	
	ic_in = cmp.source('source intercool')
	ic_out = cmp.sink('sink intercool')

	c_out = cmp.sink('coolant out')

	# compressor-system

	cp1 = cmp.compressor('compressor 1')
	cp2 = cmp.compressor('compressor 2')
	he = cmp.heat_exchanger('intercooler')

Connections
+++++++++++

As done before, add the new connections to the script. After the second compressor we need to install a sink, because closing a circuit will always lead to linear dependency. Just make sure, the fluid properties at the sink after the compressor are identical to the fluid properties at the source connected to the condenser. Another way of doing this, is adding a merge and a splitter at some point of your network. Nevertheless, you will require a sink and a source.

.. code-block:: python

	# compressor-system

	cp1_he = con.connection(cp1, 'out1', he, 'in1')
	he_cp2 = con.connection(he, 'out1', cp2, 'in1')
	cp2_c_out = con.connection(cp2, 'out1', c_out, 'in1')

	ic_in_he = con.connection(ic_in, 'out1', he, 'in2')
	he_ic_out = con.connection(he, 'out2', ic_out, 'in1')

	nw.add_conns(cp1_he, he_cp2, ic_in_he, he_ic_out, cp2_c_out)

Parametrization
+++++++++++++++

For the two compressor we defined an isentropic efficency and for the offdesign calculation a generic characteristic line for the isentropic efficiency will be applied. The first compressor has a fixed pressure ratio, the seconds compressor pressure ratio will result from the required pressure at the condenser. The heat exchanger comes with pressure ratios on both sides. The parametrization of all other components remains identical.

.. code-block:: python

	cp1.set_attr(eta_s=0.8, design=['eta_s'], offdesign=['eta_s_char'])
	cp2.set_attr(eta_s=0.8, pr=5, design=['eta_s'], offdesign=['eta_s_char'])
	he.set_attr(pr1=0.99, pr2=0.98, design=['pr1', 'pr2'], offdesign=['zeta1', 'zeta2', 'kA'])

	
Regarding the connections, on the hot side after the intercooler we set the temperature. For the cold side of the heat exchanger we set the temperature, the pressure and the fluid on the inlet flow, at the outlet we specify the temperature as a design parameter. In offdesign calculation, this will be a result from the given heat transfer coefficient (see parametrisation of intercooler, kA is an offdesign parameter). Last, make sure the fluid properties after the compressor outlet are identical to those at the condenser inlet using the references.

The last step leads to a necessary redefinition of the parametrization of the existing model: As the enthalpy at the outlet of the second compressor is a result of the given pressure ratio and the isentropic efficiency, it is not allowed to set the temperature at the condenser's hot inlet anymore. This is due to forcing the fluid properties at the compressor's outlet and the condenser's hot side inlet to be identical with the references.

.. code-block:: python

	# condenser system
	
	c_in_cd.set_attr(fluid={'water': 0, 'NH3': 1})

	# compressor-system

	he_cp2.set_attr(T=40, p0=10, design=['T'])
	ic_in_he.set_attr(p=1, T=20, fluid={'water': 1, 'NH3': 0})
	he_ic_out.set_attr(T=30, design=['T'])
	cp2_c_out.set_attr(p=con.ref(c_in_cd, 1, 0), h=con.ref(c_in_cd, 1, 0))


Solve
+++++

Here again, using the saved results from previous calculations is always favourable, but with the manually adjusted starting values, the calculation should still converge. Also see section 3.2.4. If you want to use the previous part to initialise start the solver with

.. code-block:: python

	nw.solve('design', init_path='condenser_eva')


Further tasks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After successfully modeling the heat pump in design and offdesign cases, you can now start using your model for further calculations.
E. g., if you have a time series of required heat flow of your consumer, you can loop over the series and perform offdesign calculation adjusting the heat flow every time.
Of course, this is possible with every offdesign parameter. We provide the scripts after each of the three steps of the tutorial:
:download:`Step 1 <../tutorial/step_1.py>`, :download:`Step 2 <../tutorial/step_2.py>`, :download:`Step 3 <../tutorial/step_3.py>`.

Have fun working with TESPy!
