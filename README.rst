TESPy stands for "Thermal Engineering Systems in Python" and provides a powerful simulation toolkit for thermal engineering plants such as power plants, district heating systems or heat pumps. It is an external extension module within the `Open Energy System Modeling Framework <https://oemof.org/>`_ and can be used as a standalone package.

With the TESPy package you are able to calculate stationary operation in order to design the process of your plant. From that point it is possible to calculate the offdesign behaviour of your plant using underlying characteristics for each of the plants components. For now, the package inlcudes basic components, such as turbines, pumps, compressors, heat exchangers, pipes, mixers and splitters as well as some advanced components (derivatives of heat exchangers, drum).

Everybody is welcome to use and/or develop TESPy. Contribution is already possible on a low level by simply fixing typos in TESPy's documentation or rephrasing sections which are unclear. If you want to support us that way please fork the TESPy repository to your own github account and make changes as described in the github guidelines: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

Documentation
=============

You can find the full documentation at `readthedocs <http://tespy.readthedocs.org>`_. Use the `project site <http://readthedocs.org/projects/tespy>`_ of readthedocs to choose the version of the documentation. Go to the `download page <http://readthedocs.org/projects/tespy/downloads/>`_ to download different versions and formats (pdf, html, epub) of the documentation. Currently, only the dev branch is available.

To get the latest news visit and follow our `website <https://www.oemof.org>`_.

Installing TESPy
================

If you have a working Python3 environment, use pypi to install the latest tespy version:

.. code:: bash

  pip install tespy

If you want to use the latest features, you might want to install the **developer version**. See section `Developing TESPy <http://tespy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing_tespy.html>`_ for more information. The developer version is not recommended for productive use.

Examples
========

For a short introduction on how TESPy works and how you can use it, we provide some `basic examples and tutorials <http://tespy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html>`_, go and check them out. You can download the python scripts of all example plants from the `tespy_examples repository <https://github.com/oemof/oemof-examples/tree/master/oemof_examples/tespy>`_.
